### [July 3rd, 2025](3rdJuly2025/README.md)

**Topic: Builder Design Pattern Deep Dive**

A comprehensive exploration of the Builder design pattern, including detailed explanations, class diagrams, and multiple implementations. This guide covers how the Builder pattern provides abstraction and includes examples from various domains.

**Files:**
- [README.md](3rdJuly2025/README.md) - Detailed explanation of the Builder pattern
- [Aircraft Builder Example](../src/main/java/com/boot/designpatterns/builder/aircraft/) - Implementation of the Builder pattern for aircraft construction
- [Document Builder Example](../src/main/java/com/boot/designpatterns/builder/document/) - Implementation of the Builder pattern for document generation
- [Person Builder Example](../src/main/java/com/boot/designpatterns/builder/) - Simple Builder pattern implementation with Person class
- [run_aircraft_builder_demo.bat](../run_aircraft_builder_demo.bat) - Batch file to run Aircraft Builder demo
- [run_document_builder_demo.bat](../run_document_builder_demo.bat) - Batch file to run Document Builder demo
- [run_all_builder_demos.bat](../run_all_builder_demos.bat) - Batch file to run all Builder pattern demos

**Key Concepts:**
- Separation of construction from representation
- Step-by-step object construction
- Creating different representations using the same construction process
- Builder pattern usage in Spring Boot and Selenium
- Comparison with other creational patterns

### [July 2nd, 2025](2ndJuly2025/README.md)

**Topic: Design Patterns - Singleton and Builder**

A comprehensive exploration of two important design patterns: Singleton and Builder. This guide explains the concepts, implementations, and practical applications of these patterns in Java, Spring Boot, and Selenium.

**Files:**
- [README.md](2ndJuly2025/README.md) - Detailed explanation of both design patterns
- [Singleton implementations](../src/main/java/com/boot/designpatterns/singleton/) - Various Singleton pattern implementations
- [Builder implementation](../src/main/java/com/boot/designpatterns/builder/) - Builder pattern implementation with Person class
- [run_singleton_demo.bat](../run_singleton_demo.bat) - Batch file to run Singleton pattern demo
- [run_builder_demo.bat](../run_builder_demo.bat) - Batch file to run Builder pattern demo
- [run_design_patterns_demo.bat](../run_design_patterns_demo.bat) - Batch file to run both demos

**Key Concepts:**
- Singleton pattern and thread safety considerations
- Builder pattern for complex object creation
- Design pattern usage in Spring Boot and Selenium
- Immutability and fluent interfaces
- Practical implementation examples

### [July 1st, 2025](1stJuly2025/README.md)

**Topic: SortedSquares Algorithm**

A deep dive into the SortedSquares algorithm, which efficiently squares each element in a sorted array and returns the result in sorted order.

**Files:**
- [README.md](1stJuly2025/README.md) - Detailed explanation of the algorithm
- [SortedSquares.java](1stJuly2025/SortedSquares.java) - Java implementation
- [SortedSquaresTest.java](1stJuly2025/SortedSquaresTest.java) - Test cases
- [algorithm_visualization.md](1stJuly2025/algorithm_visualization.md) - Visual representation of the algorithm
- [run_sorted_squares_test.bat](1stJuly2025/run_sorted_squares_test.bat) - Batch file to compile and run tests

**Key Concepts:**
- Two-pointer technique
- O(n) time complexity optimization
- Handling negative numbers in sorted arrays
- Comparing absolute values for squaring operations
