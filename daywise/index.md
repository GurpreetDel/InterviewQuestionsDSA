# Daywise Directory Structure

This directory contains daily implementations, explanations, and analyses of various algorithms and data structures.

## Available Days

### [July 1st, 2023](./1stJuly2023/README.md)

**Topic: SortedSquares Algorithm**

A deep dive into the SortedSquares algorithm, which efficiently squares each element in a sorted array and returns the result in sorted order.

**Files:**
- [README.md](./1stJuly2023/README.md) - Detailed explanation of the algorithm
- [SortedSquares.java](./1stJuly2023/SortedSquares.java) - Java implementation
- [SortedSquaresTest.java](./1stJuly2023/SortedSquaresTest.java) - Test cases
- [algorithm_visualization.md](./1stJuly2023/algorithm_visualization.md) - Visual representation of the algorithm
- [run_sorted_squares_test.bat](./1stJuly2023/run_sorted_squares_test.bat) - Batch file to compile and run tests

**Key Concepts:**
- Two-pointer technique
- O(n) time complexity optimization
- Handling negative numbers in sorted arrays
- Comparing absolute values for squaring operations

## How to Use This Directory

1. Navigate to the specific day you're interested in
2. Read the README.md file for a detailed explanation
